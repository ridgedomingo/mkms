				<h2>2016-present</h2>
				<p>Twenty seven (27) years is a long time but it seems to be only yesterday.
					And yet considering the many projects, accomplishments and achievements of the
					Makati Medical Society for the welfare of the community and of its members,
					we who had a hand in the birth of the society, nurturing and caring for it
					during its early and “pledging” years, can now sit back with a little smile on our lips,
					 a little misty eyed, unruffling our thinning and praying hair and whisper,
					 “thank God… it was well worth it.” </p>
